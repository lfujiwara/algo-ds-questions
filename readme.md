# Algorithms/Data Structures Questions

Just some questions and my own answers and explanations. Links to sites like leetcode are just for reference, you can find these questions all over the internet, and hopefully on an interview.

## Structure

Questions/Answers are under the `questions` directory, each question has it's own directory, with solutions, a readme with an explanation, and a `question.json` file with possibly an url to the question at some online judge and the question name, maybe I'll use this later to generate a website or something.
